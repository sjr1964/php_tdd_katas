# PHP TDD Katas

## Prerequisites
- PHP >= 8.3
- Composer >= 2.7
- Docker

I have made this repository of TDD Katas implemented in PHP to teach and coach my development team in the ways of TDD. It is a work in progress and will be updated with new katas as and when we practice them.

Thus far, the available katas are

1. FizzBuzz
2. Leap Year
3. Twelve days of Christmas
